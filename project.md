#### On Conctruction of a non-cryogenic, low magnetic field MRI machine ####

The goal of this collaborative project is to design a cheap system, which can be used for conducting MRI scans of limbs. Our proposed system works in micro tesla range of the magnetic field. Being based on this low intensity magnetic range, it does not require expensive cryogenic cooling and shielding systems of ordinary MRI machines. During my stay at IIIT, we successfully implemented and tested the basic working principle and the proposal was accepted by DRDO.


#### Efficient statistical algorithms for speaker identification under noisy conditions ####

Here, we designed algorithms for detection of the unknown speaker of an utterance from a closed set of speakers. We extracted Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) as features from speech signals and trained speaker-specific Gaussian Mixture models on those extracted features. We tested the efficacy of our method on large, noisy speech datasets such as NTIMIT (630 speakers) and IViE (36 speakers). (Software Used: MATLAB)


#### Completion of the SCILAB TEXT BOOK COMPANION Project Conducted By IIT, Bombay ####

Under the guidance of my mentor, I have successfully completed the SCILAB Text Book Companion Project, which is conducted by IIT, Bombay. It involved coding exhaustive solutions to the exercises in the popular engineering undergraduate textbook Signal and Systems by P. R. Babu and R. Anandanatarajan. For the project I had received an honorarium of Rs. 10,000.


#### Study of different relay protocols used for cooperative communication in a Raleigh fading channel B. Tech Final Semester Project ####

Through analytical expressions as well as simulation experiments, we study the operational characteristics of different relay protocols such as fixed amplify and forward relaying protocol (AF), fixed decode and forward relaying protocol (DF), direct relay ADF protocol, hybrid ADF protocol, optimum relay selection and multiple relays using hybrid relay network. Our study shows that, among the first three protocols DF performs the best and using multiple relays we substantially decrease the overall outage probability. (Software Used: MATLAB)


#### Ethernet MDIO Master-Slave and Register Design ####

We construct an Ethernet network focusing on the design part of MDIO lines, Master-Slave and register blocks.
Typically, 32 registers are used. Here, addressing the issues of data collision, we show that an appreciable increase in
data storage can be attained by increasing the number of registers. (Software Used: Verilog, Cadence)
